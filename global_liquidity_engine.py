SFC Global Liquidity Engine (GLF — Global Liquidity Factor)
===========================================================
Consolidates ALL liquidity signals into ONE composite factor:

  Fed Balance Sheet (WALCL YoY)
  ECB Balance Sheet (ECBASSETSW YoY)
  PBOC/BOJ Balance Sheet (JPNASSETS YoY)
  TGA Balance (WTREGEN — fiscal liquidity drain)
  RRP Facility (RRPONTSYD — money market liquidity)
  DXY (USD Index — global dollar liquidity)
  US M2 Money Supply (M2SL YoY)
  Global GLO Index (from M33)

Output: GLF score 0–100 and SFC-mapped score 0–1
  High GLF (>70) = abundant liquidity = low stress (0.1–0.3)
  Low GLF (<30) = liquidity contraction = high stress (0.7–0.9)
